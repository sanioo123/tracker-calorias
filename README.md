# tracker-calorias

Calorie Tracker is a scalable web application designed to help users monitor and manage their daily calorie intake effectively. It supports secure user registration and login, allowing personalized tracking of consumed calories against customizable daily goals. The app features motivational quotes to keep users inspired on their fitness journey, all built on a robust and secure infrastructure using technologies like Next.js for the frontend and backend, Tailwind CSS for styling to create a fresh and friendly user interface, and MySQL as the database to ensure data privacy and performance for all users. I recommend deploying this on an Ubuntu 20.04 server.

### Enhanced Security with Cloudflare
For greater security, integrate Cloudflare by enabling its proxy mode (the orange cloud icon). This provides DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and traffic optimization, safeguarding the application against threats while maintaining high performance.
